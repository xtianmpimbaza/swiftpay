      <p> Ladies and Gentlemen,
      </p>
      <p> The dawn of a new technology often creates excitement and presents great opportunity; and as it has done in
        the
        past, this great opportunity favours early adopters. Nations that responded favourably at the dawn of the
        internet, and at the dawn of mobile telephony reaped well on the opportunity and are today prosperous nations.
        Although Africa has missed out at the onset of many technologies, a new one is now upon us – blockchain – and
        Africa must not miss out again!
      </p>
      <p> Blockchain is one of the 4th Industrial Revolution technologies (4IRs), a phrase coined by World Economic
        Forum
        in reference to technologies that are fusing humanity and technology. 4IR along with its predecessors, 3IR, 2IR
        and 1IR have all had distinct disruptive marks in history. 1IR saw the onset of the steam engine, 2IR the
        revolution of electricity, 3IR the dawn of the internet, and 4IR the fusion of technologies blurring the lines
        with physical, digital and biological spheres, some of which include artificial intelligence, blockchain and
        robotics.
      </p>
      <p> Committed to ensuring Africa does not miss out again, but instead leverages the opportunity that new
        technology
        presents, the Africa Blockchain Conference will host delegates from Africa and around the world to consider the
        role of blockchain technology in Africa’s transformation. Through keynote speeches, panel discussions, breakout
        sessions and exhibitions, participants will engage on how to create a thriving blockchain business ecosystem
        while
        setting in place the appropriate policies for the nascent industry. Relevant use cases from different sectors in
        the African context will also be highlighted.
      </p>
      <p> On behalf of the organizing committee, it is my pleasure to welcome you to Uganda – the pearl of Africa – to
        join us for the Africa Blockchain Conference, which I trust will be informative, insightful and impactful.
      </p>
